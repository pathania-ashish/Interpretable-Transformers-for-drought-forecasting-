Abstract
The impacts of climate change are increasingly visible in the form of severe droughts across all regions of the world, leading to amplified socio-economic and environmental repercussions. Proactive drought management requires effective forecasting and an improved understanding of the underlying hydro-climatic variables. The present study focuses on developing a national-scale drought forecasting model tailored to the diverse climatic zones of India. This model leverages the attention-based transformer framework to forecast SPEI-3 values at a lead time of 30, 60, and 90 days respectively while interpreting the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. The model predicted the SPEI-3 values with Root Means Square Error (RMSE) 0.66±0.08 and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient (NSE) 0.51±0.14 at a lead time of 30 days. Prediction uncertainty through quantile forecasting enhances the model's utility for effective decision-making and risk management. Model performance varies on the seasonal scale with higher accuracy in post-monsoon (Oct-Nov) and a relative decline in the pre-monsoon (March- May) season.
